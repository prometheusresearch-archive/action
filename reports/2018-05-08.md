# Presentation Plan

* Previously

* Small Things

* CRUD

* Demo

* Summary



# Previously

* We have a Query Language (QC)

* ... extended with UI values and combinators

* ... and a Workflow Language (topic we are going to discuss!)



# Small Things

Less visible but important things done. Worth mention:

* Refactor `JSONDatabase` implementation to be closer to relational model

  Specifically model relationships via foreign keys. This is useful in browser
  too and also makes us closer to real relational databases.

* Add more combinators:

  * Filtering datasets with `filter`
  * Comparisons for numerics: `<` / `>` / `<=` / `>=`
  * Equality: `=` / `!=`
  * ...

* More internal refactorings and implementation documentation.

  Specify interfaces between subsystems, tests, comments, ...



# CRUD

  "Try dumb things first, no rocket science"



# CRUD: Value-level representation

A new data type:

    type mutation

We can execute mutations using a new DB method:

    val execute : mutation -> unit

which updates the database.



# CRUD: Combinators

New combinators:

* Update field with a query result
* Update entity field-by-field
* Create entity field-by-field



# CRUD: Example Queries

Using a constant query:

    region["ASIA"]:update {
      name: "Asia (a continent)"
    }



# CRUD: Example Queries

Using a query based on the current value:

    identity[42]:update {
      fullname: givenname + " " + surname
    }



# CRUD: Example Queries

Updating linked entities:

    individual[42]:update {
      father: update {
        site: /site["portal"]
      },
      mother: update {
        site: /site["portal"]
      }
    }



# CRUD: Example Queries

Creating linked entities:

    individual[42]:update {
      site: create {
        title: "New Site"
      }
    }



# CRUD: UI

Add `form` combinator which renders a form UI given a form specification.

**Definition:**: Form Specification is (hand wavy here) mutation + UI.

At runtime `form` combinator produces a mutation spec out of form spec and
submits mutation spec to execution on submit.



# CRUD: UI (part 2)

Create individual form:

    individual:form {
      title: "Add New Individual",
      spec: create {
        name: :text,
        birthdate: :date,
        site: :autocomplete,
      }
    }



# CRUD: Demo

    ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ DEMO TIME ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

    (not really the same I've described above but close)



# Workflow Language

**Definition**:

  Configure how a user can transition between screens.

Another **Definition**:

  Describe what UI queries are possible to build.



# Workflow Language: Previously

Workflow is either:

* A screen specified by a `QUERY`:

    render(QUERY)

* A composition - a list of alternatives which come after a `WORKFLOW`:

    WORKFLOW {
      WORKFLOW1,
      WORKFLOW2,
      ...
      WORKFLOWN
    }



# Workflow Language: Previously

Not ideal, even suboptimal:

* How to specify multiple alternatives at the root of a workflow?

* How to describe recursive workflows?

* Poor composability.



# Workflow Language

**WARNING:** The following proposal isn't implemented yet, though implementation
is started in the following modules:

* `WorkflowLang` - abstract workflows over monoidal structures
* `QueryWorkflow` - `WorkflowLang` specialized for queries

# Workflow Language: Workflow Modules

**Definition:** Workflow Module is a set of named workflows:

    main =
      WORKFLOW

    pickOrMakeIndividiual =
      WORKFLOW

    todoWorkflow =
      WORKFLOW

Execution starts with a workflow named `main`.



# Workflow Language: Workflow Syntax

**Definition**: Workflow is either:

* A screen specified by a `QUERY`:

    QUERY

  "Render a screen"

* `->` - a left query composition operator:

    QUERY -> WORKFLOW

  "Navigate using `QUERY` before running `WORKFLOW`"

* `;` - a sequential composition operator:

    WORKFLOW1 ; WORKFLOW2

  "Execute workflows one by one"

* `|` - a parallel composition operator:

    WORKFLOW1 | WORKFLOW2

  "Execute one of the workflows"

* `goto` operator:

    goto NAME

  "Transition to another workflow by `NAME`"



# Workflow Language: Precedence

Precedence, from higher to lower: `->`, `;`, `|`

Can be overridden using parens `(` and `)`.



# Workflow Language: Examples

"Pick then view" workflow:

    main =
      individual:pick;
      value:view



# Workflow Language: Examples

"Pick then view related" workflow:

    main =
      individual:pick;
      value.country:view


# Workflow Language: Examples

Simplest parallel composition:

    main =
      identity:pick;
      (value:view | value.individual:view)

or moving the RHS of `;` into the separate workflow:

    main =
      identity:pick;
      goto identityWorkflow

    identityWorkflow =
      | value:view
      | valie.individual:view



# Workflow Language: Examples

Multiple screens at the root:

    main =
      | individual:pick
      | todo:pick
      | ...



# Workflow Language: Examples

Use left query composition for resuable workflows composition.

Define `todoWorkflow` which can work on queries of type `seq[todo]`:

    todoWorkflow =
      here:pick;
      value:view

The important part is that it doesn't depend on the way `seq[todo]` query is
obtained.

Now we can use the `todoWorkflow` with all todos in the system:

    main = todo -> goto todoWorkflow

Or we can use it at any place a `seq[todo]` is available:

    main =
      individual:pick;
      value.todo -> goto todoWorkflow



# Workflow Language: Examples

Use left query composition to model conditional branches:

    main =
      todo:pick;
      goto todoWorkflow

    todoWorkflow =
      | value:view
      | valie:filter(status != "completed") -> todoComplete

    todoComplete = ...



# Summary: Status

* Query Language: New combinators added, ...

* Workflow Language: Implementation Started

* CRUD: Prototype Implemented, blocked on Workflow language for useful examples
